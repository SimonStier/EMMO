However, in the EMMO we restrict the meaning of the word process to items whose evolution in time have a particular meaning for the ontologist (i.e. every 4D object unfolds in time, but not every 4D time unfolding may be of interest for the ontologist and categorized as a process).

For this reason, the definition of every specific process subclass requires the introduction of a primitive concept."""@en ;

However, this is a too narrow definition, since the general idea of a process is not always focused on the concepts of input and output but for example on the evolution of a whole (e.g. the evolution of a studend into an engineer, or the process of ageing) for which the concept of initial state and final state may be more accurate (since they refer to the evolution of a whole that keep its continuity) instead of input and output (that may refer to destruction and creation of two separate entities).

A process in the ISO9000:2005 spirit is more in the direction of an activity designed and implemented for a specific purpose and expressed as a subclass of the EMMO process aimed to catch the concept of intentional process."""@en ;

	rdfs:comment """The interest is on the 4D object as it extends in time (process) or as it persists in time (object).

The concepts of endurant and perdurant implicitly rely on the concept of instantaneous 3D snapshot of the world object, that in the EMMO is not allowed since everything extends in 4D and there are no abstract objects. Moreover, time is a measured property in the EMMO and not an objective characteristic of an object, and cannot be used as temporal index to identify endurant position in time. 

For this reason an individual in the EMMO can always be classified both endurant and perdurant, due to its nature of 4D entity (e.g. an individual may belong both to the class of runners and the class of running process), and the distinction is purely semantic.

Nevertheless, it is useful to introduce categorizations that characterize persistency through continuant and occurrent concepts, even if not ontologically but only cognitively defined. This is also due to the fact that our language distinguish between nouns and verbs to address things, forcing the separation between things that happens and things that persist.

This perspective provides classes conceptually similar to the concepts of endurant and perdurant (a.k.a. continuant and occurrent). We claim that this distinction is motivated by our cognitive bias, and we do not commit to the fact that both these kinds of entity “do really exist”. For this reason, a whole instance can be both process and object, according to different cognitive approaches (see Wonderweb D17).

The distinction between endurant and perdurant as usually introduced in literature (see BFO SPAN/SNAP approach) is then lost at ontological level, but can remain through the introduction of ad hoc primitive definitions that follow the interpreter endurantist or perdurantist attitude."""@en ;

However that's not possible in general, since we will finally end to temporal parts whose temporal extension is so small that the connectivity relations that define the object will no longer hold. That's the case when the temporal interval is lower than the interval that characterize the causality interactions between the object parts.

In other terms, if the time span of a temporal part is lower than the inverse of the frequency of interactions between the constituents, then the constituents in such temporal part are not connected. The object is no more an object, neither an item, but simply a collection of fundamental parts.

To overcome this issue, we can identify an minimum holistic temporal part (a lower time interval value), below which a specific definition for an object type does not hold anymore, that is called a fundamental."""@en ;
